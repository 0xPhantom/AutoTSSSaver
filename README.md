This program is written in Python 3.6.4 and so far only works on Mac which can be adapted to Windows or Linux by changing the name of the program in the subprocess.call command. 

I do NOT recommend you use this program on Windows however you are free to use this on a server or something to allow others to save their blobs.

# How to use

Download the Python project above.
Download TSSChecker from here: https://github.com/tihmstar/tsschecker.
Extract the files from TSSChecker into the same directory as the script.
Open a terminal and chmod +x the file which will be executed.
Run the script.

# Optional

If you are on any other OS then you may have to edit to subprocess.call command from ./tsschecker_macos to tsschecker_windows.exe and etc.

If you are editing the file name for Windows, be sure to remove the ./ otherwise the program will fail to find the tsschecker executable.




I am NOT responsible for any damages that this may (somehow) cause to any of your devices although it is not possible.
